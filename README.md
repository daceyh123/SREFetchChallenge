 Hello There,
 below you will find directions on how to prepare your environment as well as install the correct packages needed to run this program that will create an EC2 instance in Amazon Web Services (AWS). I will break each down into steps then at the end we will have you run the program and ssh into the linux machine with one of the user accounts. Also, this project will allow you to make configuration changes based on the YAML file in this repo. All you will have to do is change the yaml file and run the program after the environment has been setup correctly.
