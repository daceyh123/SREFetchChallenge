 Hello There,
 below you will find directions on how to prepare your environment as well as install the correct packages needed to run this program that will create an EC2 instance in Amazon Web Services (AWS). I will break each down into steps then at the end we will have you run the program and ssh into the linux machine with one of the user accounts. Also, this project will allow you to make configuration changes based on the YAML file in this repo. All you will have to do is change the yaml file and run the program after the environment has been setup correctly.
 
 ## Step One - Download Python (Skip if this is already done)
 
 Please head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of python (as of writing this, it is Python 3.9.5). Go through the setup selecting Install Now as well as checking off the box "Add Python to Path" at the bottom of the setup window. If you want to make sure that it installed correctly you can follow the steps below:
 ### Windows
 
 1. Hit the windows button on your keyboard and type in "cmd" and hit enter.
 2. Type in "python" and you should see something similar to this output: Python 3.7.4 (tags/v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 19:29:22) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 3. If this is the ouput that you get then type in "exit()"
